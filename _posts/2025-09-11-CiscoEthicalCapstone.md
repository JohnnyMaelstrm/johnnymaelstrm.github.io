# Cisco Ethical Hacking-course at Tamk

I applied to the course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK).  
This is one of the “Lab” projects we completed during the course. The projects are in either Finnish or English.  
I will also upload the Capstone project here!

# This is the Cisco Ethical Hacking course's Capstone-project! The course ends here. Really fun and interesting course that really pushed me towards the cybersecurity.
