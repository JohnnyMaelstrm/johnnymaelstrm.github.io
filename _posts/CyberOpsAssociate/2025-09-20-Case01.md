## As part of our CyberOps Associate course, we are required to do 4 cases! This was the first one.

### Everything here is still under construction, as the case deadlines have not yet been met. And I wonâ€™t spoil the fun for the others attending this course.

Scenario was quite simple: The suspicion arose after the company repeatedly lost bids to a foreign competitor, raising concerns about internal data breaches.
I was hired to examine what really happened.

I was given a network traffic capture file `(PCAP)` that I need to analyze using Wireshark. The file was medium size ( 50 k).

The analysis focused on traffic involving the company's archiving system ( sp.wpk.tpu.fi), which stores sensitive documents as `.jpg` files.

The first task was to identify every `IP-address` on the file. This helped map out the network traffic and associate devices with specific users.
