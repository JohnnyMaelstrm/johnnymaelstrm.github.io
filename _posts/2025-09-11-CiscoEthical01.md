# Cisco Ethical Hacking-course at Tamk

I applied to the course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK).  
This is one of the “Lab” projects we completed during the course. The projects are in either Finnish or English.  
I will also upload the Capstone project here!

The Lab projects were done at the university using school computers within a closed network environment.  
The Capstone project was also carried out at the university, but it was a larger and more comprehensive assignment that had a significant impact on the final course grade.
