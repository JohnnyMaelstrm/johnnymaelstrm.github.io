# Who, me?

I am a third-year IT student at Tampere University of Applied Sciences, with a strong focus on telecommunications, computer networks, and cybersecurity.

I am highly motivated by various cybersecurity and networking roles, such as:

- Red Teaming
- Ethical Hacking
- SOC
- Network Specialist
- SDR

I develop my cybersecurity skills through Cisco badges and by completing hands-on hacking exercises in TAMK courses. I am eager to put these skills into practice in real-world projects and challenges. I also continuously improve by following the cybersecurity field closely and working on personal projects, all of which are available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/JohnnyMaelstrm) or here in my portfolioâ€”they are basically the same thing ðŸ˜„.

My biggest point of pride is my ongoing thesis, which focuses on cybersecurity from an offensive perspective. The topic is C2-frameworks, allowing me to combine my key interests while diving deep into a fascinating area of research.

I enjoy working on projects and in teams where I can apply analytics, problem-solving, and creative thinking.

If youâ€™d like to discuss cybersecurity, my projects, or **INTERNSHIP opportunities** â€” feel free to get in touch!
