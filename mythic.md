# Thesis

As part of my Bachelor's degree, I am required to complete a thesis — and what could be a better topic than one related to cybersecurity and red teaming, two of my biggest passions!

I chose Mythic C2, a modular and extensible command-and-control framework, as the focus of my thesis. I initially considered using Havoc for my thesis, but ultimately decided to focus on Mythic instead.

I try to update this page as my thesis work progresses. It is now being reviewed by my thesis supervisor.
